# Crypto Alerts

Toolkit for sending different types of cryptocurrency alerts.

i.e.: Whenever a TVL of a specific DeFi project moves +/- X% within a certain period, an alert is raised, and an email sent. 

This is usefull for being able to execute some quick actions in a bear/bull market situation.

Alerts implementations are defined in ```alerts.py```
